## About the .loc Language and Compiler

This project is a simple compiler for my own programming language, using the `.loc` file extension (Louielee Own Compiler).  
The compiler reads `.loc` source code and translates it into a lower-level form, showing how a basic programming language works from reading the code to producing output.
